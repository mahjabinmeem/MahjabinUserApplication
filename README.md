# UserApp

This is an application that creates,deletes and updates user data. There us two types of users, Parent and Child. The child doesn't have an address and belongs to a parent.

The first name of a Parent user acts as the primary key for the parent type user. The first name of a Child user acts as the primary key for the Child type user. To create a child type user, it must have a Parent existing in the database. 

Select Add Parent/Add Child buttons on home screen to create respective user types. It will lead to a page where further actions such as deleting and updating user can be done.

After deleting/updating a user info, press back and load the list again to see the updated list.
